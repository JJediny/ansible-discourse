Operating system support
************************

I’m primarily interested in CentOS 7. I’m least interested in Ubuntu. However, I
make an effort to support all of the distributions below.

* CentOS 7

  - NGINX and Redis are installed from my own GPG-signed repositories.

* Debian 8 (Jessie)

  - NGINX is installed from my own GPG-signed repository.

  - Redis is installed from Jessie Backports.

* Fedora 22

  - Redis is installed from my own GPG-signed repository.

* Ubuntu 15.04

  - NGINX is installed from the ppa:nginx/stable repository.

  - Redis is installed from the ppa:chris-lea/redis repository.
